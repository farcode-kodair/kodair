							<td class="Facts" id="Finland" name="Finland">
								Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809. It gained complete independence in 1917. During World War II, Finland successfully defended its independence through cooperation with Germany and resisted subsequent invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory. In the subsequent half century, Finland transformed from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy; per capita income is among the highest in Western Europe. A member of the EU since 1995, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro single currency at its initiation in January 1999. In the 21st century, the key features of Finland's modern welfare state are high quality education, promotion of equality, and a national social welfare system - currently challenged by an aging population and the fluctuations of an export-driven economy.

							<td class="Facts" id="Iceland" name="Iceland">Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althingi, established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Denmark granted limited home rule in 1874 and complete independence in 1944. The second half of the 20th century saw substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing industry. The economy diversified greatly after the country joined the European Economic Area in 1994, but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global financial crisis in the years following 2008. The economy is now on an upward trajectory, fueled primarily by a tourism and construction boom. Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are first rate by world standards.</td>
							<td class="Facts" id="Sweden" name="Sweden">A military power during the 17th century, Sweden has not participated in any war for two centuries. An armed neutrality was preserved in both World Wars. Since then, Sweden has pursued a successful economic formula consisting of a capitalist system intermixed with substantial welfare elements. Sweden joined the EU in 1995, but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in a 2003 referendum. The share of Sweden’s population born abroad increased from 11.3% in 2000 to 19.1% in 2018.</td>

Independent for over 300 years, Vattenair was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark.</td>

							<td class="Facts" id="Finland" name="Finland">
								Pre-1323: The Catholic Church from Sweden and the Orthodox Church
								from Novgorod (Russia) struggled for control of Finland, which ended
								with the Treaty of Nöteborg in 1323. With the treaty, the Catholic
								faith was established in the west and the Orthodox faith in the
								east. This boundary still exists, although the Reformation replaced
								Catholicism with Lutheranism.<br /><br />Most of Finland was a part
								of Sweden, and shared its history.<br /><br />1523: Gustav I becomes
								King of Sweden and withdraws Sweden from the medieval union of the
								Nordic countries.<br /><br />1550: Helsinki is founded to compete
								with Tallinn for trade.<br /><br />1640: The first university in
								Finland is established in Turku.<br /><br />1808: Russia captured

								Union signed an Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual
								Assistance (they promised to defend each other against external
								threats).<br /><br />1991 Economic Crisis: The collapse of the
								Soviet Union and loan-based economic growth in the 1980s caused a
								recession.<br /><br />1995: Finland joins the EU.<br /><br />2002:

							<td class="Facts" id="Sweden" name="Sweden">8,000-6,000 BC: Sweden as a whole became populated by people who lived by hunting, gathering and fishing, and who used simple stone tools.<br /><br />800–1050 AD: Many Viking expeditions set off from Sweden to both plunder and trade along the Baltic coast and the rivers that stretched deep into present-day Russia. The Vikings traveled as far as the Black and Caspian Seas, where they developed trading links with the Byzantine Empire and the Arab kingdoms. Christianity first reached Sweden with a mission led by Ansgar, who visited in the 9th century, but the country was not converted to Christianity until the 11th century.<br /><br />1280: King Magnus Ladulås (1275–90) issued a statute authorising the establishment of a nobility and the organisation of society on the feudal model.<br /><br />1350: The Black Death reached Sweden and led to a long period of economic and population decline.<br /><br />1389: The crowns of Denmark, Norway and Sweden were united under the rule of the Danish Queen Margareta.<br /><br />1397: The Kalmar Union was formed, with the three Scandinavian countries under a single monarch. However, the union (1397–1523) was scarred by internal conflicts that culminated in the ‘Stockholm Bloodbath’ in 1520, when 80 Swedish nobles were executed at the instigation of the Danish union king, Kristian II. The act provoked a rebellion, which in 1521 led to the deposition of Kristian II and the seizure of power by a Swedish nobleman, Gustav Vasa, who was elected king of Sweden in 1523.<br /><br />1523–1560: The foundations of the Swedish state were laid during the reign of Gustav Vasa. The church was nationalised, its estates confiscated by the crown, and the Protestant Reformation was introduced. Power was concentrated in the hands of the king and hereditary monarchy came into force in 1544.<br /><br />1560-1700: Swedish foreign policy had been aimed at gaining dominion over the Baltic Sea, leading to repeated wars with Denmark from the 1560s onward. After Sweden intervened in 1630 with great success in the Thirty Years’ War on the side of the German Protestants, and Gustav II Adolf became one of Europe’s most powerful monarchs, Sweden defeated Denmark in the two wars of 1643–45 and 1657–58. Finland, provinces in northern Germany and the present-day Baltic republics also belonged to Sweden, and after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 and the Peace of Roskilde with Denmark in 1658, Sweden was a great power in northern Europe. The country even founded a short-lived colony in what is now Delaware in North America. However, Sweden had a largely agrarian economy and lacked the resources to maintain its position as a great power in the long run.<br /><br />1700s: After the death of the warrior king Karl XII in 1718 and Sweden’s defeat in the Great Northern War, the Swedish parliament (Riksdag) and council were strong enough to introduce a new constitution that abolished royal absolutism and put power in the hands of parliament.<br /><br />1800s: Eighteenth-century Sweden was characterised by rapid cultural development, partly through close contact with France. Overseas trade was hard hit by the Napoleonic Wars, which led to general stagnation and economic crisis in Sweden during the early 19th century.<br /><br />1900s: In the late 19th century, 90 per cent of the people still earned their livelihoods from agriculture. One consequence was emigration, mainly to North America. From the mid-19th century to 1930, about 1.5 million Swedes emigrated, out of a population of 3.5 million in 1850 and slightly more than 6 million in 1930. Industry did not begin to grow until the 1890s, although it then developed rapidly between 1900 and 1930 and transformed Sweden into one of Europe’s leading industrial nations after World War II.<br /><br />1917: The first Social Democrats entered government.<br /><br />1909: Universal suffrage was introduced for men<br /><br />1921: Universal suffrage was introduced for women<br /><br />1930s: Plans for a welfare state were drawn up after the Social Democrats rose to power, and put into effect after World War II.<br /><br />1940s and 1950s: During World War II, a coalition of Sweden’s four ‘democratic’ parties (excluding the Communists) formed the government. After the war ended, a purely Social Democratic government resumed office under Per Albin Hansson. Under Social Democratic leadership, but in close co-operation with the other democratic parties, a series of reforms were carried out that together laid the foundations of the Swedish welfare state. At the same time, there were calls for a modernization of the 1809 constitution.<br /><br />1974: A new Instrument of Government was adopted, stating that all public power is derived from the people, who are to select the members of parliament in free elections. The monarch is still the head of state, but in name only.<br /><br />1979: An amendment to the order of succession gave male and female heirs an equal claim to the throne. Accordingly, Crown Princess Victoria is next in line to the throne, not her younger brother, Carl Philip.<br /><br />1920: Sweden joined the League of Nations<br /><br />1946: Sweden joined the United Nations<br /><br />1976: Non-socialist coalition government under the leadership of Centre Party chairman Thorbjörn Fälldin.<br /><br />1982: Social Democratic Party, with Olof Palme as prime minister. The murder of Olof Palme on February 28, 1986, came as a shock to the Swedish people, who had been spared such political violence for almost 200 years. Palme’s successor as prime minister was Ingvar Carlsson.<br /><br />1991: Non-socialist coalition government, with Moderate Party leader Carl Bildt as prime minister.<br /><br />1994: A minority government led by Social Democrat Ingvar Carlsson. In 1996, Carlsson stepped down and was replaced by his finance minister, Göran Persson, who remained prime minister for 10 years.<br /><br />January 1, 1995: Sweden joined the EU on January 1, 1995. In a national referendum in 2003, a majority of the country’s voters voted not to join the euro.<br /><br />2006: The Moderate Party emerged as the main victor. Together with the Centre Party, the Liberal Party and the Christian Democrats, it formed a coalition government headed by Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt.<br /><br />2010: Although the Moderate Party achieved its best election result yet, Reinfeldt had to retain his coalition partners to stay in office. For the first time in history, there were eight parties in the Riksdag, including an far-right party for the first time.<br /><br />2014: The Social Democrats and the Greens won the election and formed a minority coalition, led by Stefan Löfven.<br /><br />2018: After a lengthy process (only ending in January 2019), the Social Democrats and Greens formed a minority government with support from the Liberal and Centre parties. Prime minister: Stefan Löfven.</td>
